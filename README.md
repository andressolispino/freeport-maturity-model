# FREEPORT: IoT Maturity Model Framework for SMEs

FREEPORT is a web-based framework designed to assess and improve the Internet of Things (IoT) technological maturity in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly focusing on the Latin American context. It utilizes the ATLANTIS maturity model, providing a holistic evaluation across technological, organizational, and human dimensions based on established research.

This tool helps SMEs understand their current IoT capabilities, identify areas for improvement, and plan their strategic adoption of IoT technologies.

## Configuration and Setup

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTICE:**

This project utilizes external services requiring API keys and credentials:

*   **Google Gemini API Key:** Found in `script.js` (variable `GEMINI_API_KEY`). Required for generating AI feedback.
*   **EmailJS Service ID, Template IDs, and User ID (Public Key):** Used in `script.js` (within `emailjs.init` and `emailjs.send` calls). Required for sending emails.

**DO NOT commit these keys directly into the `script.js` file or any other file in the repository, especially if the repository is public.** Exposing these keys is a security risk.

**How to Handle Keys:**

1.  **(Recommended for Deployment)** Use environment variables provided by your hosting platform (like Netlify, Vercel, or others if not using GitHub Pages for private repos). Modify `script.js` to read keys from `process.env` or the platform's equivalent.
2.  **(For Local Development)** Create a separate configuration file (e.g., `config.js`) that is *not* committed to Git (add it to `.gitignore`). Define your keys in `config.js` and import them into `script.js`.
3.  **(Manual - Least Secure)** Manually insert the keys into your local copy of `script.js` *after* cloning/downloading and *before* running. **Be extremely careful not to commit them.**

**Other Configuration:**

*   **Google Apps Script URL:** The `urlbase` variable in `script.js` points to your deployed Google Apps Script web app URL, which handles data storage. You need to deploy your own instance of the associated Apps Script code.
*   **HTML File:** The main HTML file is `Codigoo.txt`. For standard web serving and GitHub Pages, rename this file to `index.html`.

## Data Storage

Company registration data, profile answers, and calculated scores are persisted using a Google Apps Script connected to a Google Sheet, acting as a simple database. The `script.js` file interacts with the deployed Apps Script web app URL via the Fetch API to save and retrieve data.

## Team & Publications

Information about the research team and related academic publications can be found directly on the website within the 'Equipo de Trabajo' and 'Publicaciones' tabs.
